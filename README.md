# Blackwater
Blackwater is a code name for my personal website. This website will include:
general things about me,
a daily journal that I update (just for me but everyone can read it lol),
a beautiful ui that will make you fall in love,
documents on things i find (bypass wise, for a community i'm apart of),
some secrets ;),
a socials list, so you can find me in other places other than discord,
and anything I'd like to add in the future.
the site will be hosted over at http://liamsh.xyz
Also, if you'd like work or something then you can just contact me over Discord and we can probably set something up. I currently am able to design sites using CSS, and I can probably build you something fairly nice looking for a suffiecient amount of money.
